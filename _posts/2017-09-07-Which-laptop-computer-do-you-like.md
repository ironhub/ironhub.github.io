Which laptop computer do you like?
I like this one. It's top of the line.
Yes, It is , But It's much expensive than the others.
Hmm. You're right. But the price is resonable.
Okay. Let's buy it.
We also need a cooling pad for this.
How about this? I think this is better than that one.
I don't think we can afford it. it's too expensive for a cooling pad.
All right. I'll just look for a cheaper one.
