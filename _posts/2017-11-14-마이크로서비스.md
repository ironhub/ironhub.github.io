#### Microservices Architecture ####

> The microservice architectural style is an approach to developing a single application as a ***suite of small services, each running in its own process*** and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API. These services are built around ***business capabilities*** and ***independently deployable*** by fully automated deployment machinery. There is a ***bare minimum of centralized management*** of these services, which may be written in ***different programming languages*** and use ***different data storage*** technologies.  - **James Lewis and Martin Fowler**



### Micro Services###

* Independent deployable services

* Single responsibility principle

* Communication done through agnostic APIs

* Highly decoupled

  ##### Why now? #####

* Infrastructure automation

* virtualization on demand

* continuous delivery

* domain driven design

  ##### Pros and cons implementing a microservice architecture#####

  ##### Pros  #####

* Technology flexibility

* Scalability 

* Lower risk of deployment

* Small, independent teams

* Reusablility 

* Replaceability

  ##### Cons#####

* Complex infrastructure

* Complex deployment process

* Performance

* Resilience and monitoring 



##### Drivers #####

* Frequent and fast deployment
* Innovation
* attract new talent
* Current architecutre can't support furture business requirements

##### prerequisites for moving to a MicroServices Architecture#####

* Testing 
* Automation and Continous Delivery
* Evolutionary architecture 
* organizational Change

#### DevOps####

> Maturity Model 


**continuous development -> continuous Integration -> continuous testing -> continuous deployment -> continuous operations -> continuous Improvement**
